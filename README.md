## About

This repository is a collection of Jupyter notebooks and scripts as I explore machine learning concepts. The goal is to understand the theory and practical implementation of various algorithms, and to build a reference for myself and others interested in ML.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VaibhavUPratap/Machine-Learning.git
   cd Machine-Learning
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Open notebooks:**
   - Use Jupyter Notebook or VSCode to explore and run `.ipynb` files.

---

## Library Requirements

- Python 3.x
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- jupyter

Install all dependencies with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage

- Navigate to the relevant folder (e.g., `SupervisedLearning/`).
- Open the notebook you want to explore.
- Run cells step by step to see code, outputs, and explanations.
- Some notebooks may require datasets; ensure they are in the `data/` folder or update the path as needed.

## Implemented Algorithms

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Decision Trees
- K-Means Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- (More coming soon...)
